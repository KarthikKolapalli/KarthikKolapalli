👋 Hey there, I’m Karthik Kolapalli!
I’m a Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience transforming messy data into meaningful outcomes. I specialize in building automated pipelines, crafting scalable dashboards, and delivering AI-powered insights — all with a laser focus on business value creation.

💡 Whether it’s optimizing reporting workflows or designing ML models, I approach every project with the question:
“How can this solution move the needle for the business?”

🔎 I'm constantly exploring new technologies — from cloud-native stacks to generative AI — and love finding practical ways to integrate them into real-world systems.

🧠 What I Do:
Build resilient ETL pipelines using Python, SQL, and AWS to support analytics at scale

Design real-time dashboards in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel for business and product leaders

Develop applied ML solutions like churn prediction and claims forecasting (92%+ accuracy)

Explore new tech (LLMs, Azure, Spark) and evaluate how it can solve real business pain points

🏆 Highlights:
Reduced operational costs by 30% and scaled project capacity 10x with automation

Cut reporting turnaround time by 90% through centralized data workflows

Built scoring systems and dashboards that improved executive decision-making and customer targeting

🔧 Currently Exploring:
How LLMs can simplify analytics for non-technical users

Automating data quality checks with AI

Cross-platform data consolidation with low-latency performance
